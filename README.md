<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

The Indian food security system was established by the Government Of India under the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution to distribute food and non-food items to India's poor at subsidised rates.
But the FPS have been misusing the grains recieved by the government for their own profits.To reduce such conspiracy ,was the main motive behind this project.

To handle the control of entire flow of the PDS system ,this application will be useful.
